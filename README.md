# ABAP
A repository to store all the ABAP code written for learning purposes.

---
This repository stores the file containing all the ABAP code that was written outside of everyday tasks. Due to the nature of ABAP programs, it is all stored within a single file, but that is subject to change upon the future implementation of INCLUDE file or external FUNCTION MODULES.

In SAP system's environment, a version control system is not used on a daily basis and thus any part of the code, in order to be tested, ought to be manually copied from the file and into the ABAP editor within the SAP system.

In order to read the .abap file, any text editor will suffice. Notepad++ is recommended.
