# ABAP
A repository to store all the ABAP code written for learning purposes.

---
This repository stores both the single file containing all the ABAP code that was written outside of everyday tasks and all the separate files containing every program. Due to the nature of ABAP programs, initially it is all stored within a single file - abap. The file is divided into separate programs on the level of the code itself. Each program is placed in its own section.

For convenience and order maintaining purposes, separate programs are extracted from the "summary" file and stored wihtin their own files. Programs that are similar to one
another and perform the same or similar function are grouped together. Furthermore for additional convenience every group of programs is stored within a directory describing the domain of its programs. Each file's name refers to the task the program or programs it contains perform.

In the SAP system's environment, a version control system is not used on a daily basis and thus any part of the code, in order to be tested, ought to be manually copied from the file and into the ABAP editor within the SAP system.

In order to read an .abap file, any text editor will suffice. Notepad++ is recommended.
